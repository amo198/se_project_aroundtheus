# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

**Around the U.S. Project**

This project gave me the opportunity to practice responsive web design as I needed to add media queries to allow for the project to be viewable via different screen sizes. This also gave me the chance to continually practice previous skills from Sprint 1 and 2.

There was heavy emphasis on using Figma to ensure we were using the correct properties for each element. I also referred back to previous lessons and projects.

Project features include an unordered list of cards, through a larger screen with 1280 resolution, there will be 3 columns and 2 rows. As you make the screen smaller the cards will go to 2 columns with 3 rows, and then 1 column with 6 rows for phone viewing.
